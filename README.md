The title of the project is Multimodal Movie Genre Prediction.

There are single-model implementations that use either visual posters, trailers, or synopses to predict movie genres, not all together. 

I aim to use multiple features in a neural multimodal approach to achieve more accurate movie genre recommendations. This project focuses on using different neural network multimodal models (CNN, NLP, GRU) that integrates multiple features: 
 - Visual data (movie posters),
 - Numerical data (movie release year, duration, and revenue),
 - Textual data (movie synopses and taglines).

**Project Objectives in detail:**

- Content Recommendations: To help streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime provide more accurate genre-based recommendations to their users, enhancing personalised viewing experiences.
- Content Filtering:  This will improve filtering and for search engine optimisation, especially platforms can use this genre prediction to filter content according to their subscribersâ€™ preferences, also helpful in parental controls, ensuring viewers access appropriate material.
- Automated Tagging, Categorization: Movie databases and digital libraries can use this technology to tag or categorize films automatically. This will make a lot easier for users to search and browse through contents.
- Film Marketing: Movie production studios, distributors, exhibitors can tailor their promotional strategies based on the predicted genres to reach the appropriate audience across the globe more effectively.

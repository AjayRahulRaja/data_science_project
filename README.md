The title of the project is Multimodal Movie Genre Prediction.

There are single-model implementations that use either visual posters, trailers, or synopses to predict movie genres, not all together. 

I aim to use multiple features in a neural multimodal approach to achieve more accurate movie genre recommendations. This project focuses on using different neural network multimodal models (CNN, NLP, GRU) that integrates multiple features: 
 - Visual data (movie posters),
 - Numerical data (movie release year, duration, and revenue),
 - Textual data (movie synopses and taglines).

This approach aims to enhance personalized genre-based recommendations on streaming services, automate tagging and categorization in digital libraries, improve marketing strategies for film studios, and refine content filtering based on user preferences or parental controls. 

By utilizing multiple data sources, the model aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of movie genres, ultimately improving user experiences and operational efficiencies.
